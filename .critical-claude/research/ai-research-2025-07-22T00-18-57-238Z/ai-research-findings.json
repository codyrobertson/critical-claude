Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) are fundamental, with reinforcement learning showing promise for adaptive strategies against human grandmasters.",
    "detailed_analysis": "The research reveals that Minimax, enhanced by Alpha-Beta pruning, remains a cornerstone algorithm due to its ability to reduce the computation of irrelevant branches in a decision tree, thereby speeding up decision-making in chess AI.
