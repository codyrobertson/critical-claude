  "overview": "The project aims to create an AI-powered multiplayer chess game using TypeScript and websockets. The game will leverage artificial intelligence to enhance user experience, provide strategic gameplay advice, and possibly automate opponent moves in single-player mode. The use of TypeScript ensures robust application structure and type safety, while websockets enable real-time multiplayer interactions. The research will explore AI move prediction, game state management, real-time communication, and frontend-backend integration.",
