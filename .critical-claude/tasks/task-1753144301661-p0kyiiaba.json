  "title": "Prototype AI-Driven Procedural Generation Module using Specific AI Models",
  "description": "Based on the research report's emphasis on the need for empirical validation of AI models in procedural generation, develop a prototype module that integrates specific AI models, such as GANs or LSTM networks, tailored for varying game environments. This task is crucial to address the scalability and security concerns raised and to substantiate the theoretical claims with practical outcomes.",
