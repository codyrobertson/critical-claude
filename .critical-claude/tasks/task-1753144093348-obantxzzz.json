  "title": "Integrate C++ modules for performance-critical game logic in TypeScript chess game",
  "description": "To address the inefficiencies in runtime performance of TypeScript in game loops, integrating C++ for performance-critical components like game logic and AI computation will optimize the runtime performance. This hybrid approach will leverage TypeScript's maintainability with C++'s speed, fulfilling the strategic recommendation based on adversarial considerations and research insights.",
