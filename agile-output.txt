📋 CRITICAL CLAUDE AGILE TASK BREAKDOWN
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 PROJECT: User Authentication System
📅 TIMELINE: 12 days (brutal reality, not fantasy)
👥 TEAM SIZE: 2 developers
⚡ TOTAL STORY POINTS: 34

🔥 EPIC 1: Core Authentication (21 points)
├── 🎯 FOCUSED: Login/Register Forms (5 pts) - @dev1
├── 📋 TODO: Password Hashing (3 pts) 
├── 📋 TODO: Session Management (5 pts)
├── 📋 TODO: Email Verification (4 pts)
└── 📋 TODO: Rate Limiting (4 pts)

🔥 EPIC 2: Security Hardening (13 points)  
├── 🚧 IN-PROGRESS: OAuth Integration (8 pts) - @dev2
├── 📋 TODO: 2FA Implementation (3 pts)
└── 📋 TODO: Security Headers (2 pts)

🚨 BRUTAL REALITY CHECKS:
• Original estimate: 5 days ❌
• Actual timeline: 12 days ✅
• Hidden complexity: OAuth edge cases, security audits
• Risk factors: Email deliverability, rate limit tuning

💡 NEXT ACTIONS:
cc task focus auth-001        # Focus on login forms
cc task block auth-003        # Block if dependencies fail  
cc task complete auth-001     # Mark as done when tested

⚙️ CONFIGURATION:
• Max focused tasks per dev: 2
• Max in-progress tasks: 5
• Auto-archive completed: 30 days

Working code beats perfect theory. Plan for reality.
