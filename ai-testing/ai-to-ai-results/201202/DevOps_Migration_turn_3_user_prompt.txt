Perfect! I see you've made excellent progress on Phase 3 with enhanced security and performance requirements. Now I need to transition into Phase 4: Service Migration and Blue-Green Deployment Strategy. 

Given that we've compressed the timeline by 21 days and achieved 73% task parallelization, I need you to create a comprehensive Phase 4 plan that maintains this momentum while ensuring zero-downtime migration of our 500K+ daily transactions.

Specifically, I need:

1. **Blue-Green Deployment Architecture**: Design the complete blue-green deployment strategy with automated traffic switching, health checks, and rollback mechanisms for each of the 8 extracted microservices

2. **Data Synchronization Strategy**: Create detailed plans for real-time data synchronization between the monolith and microservices during the migration window, including conflict resolution and consistency validation

3. **Traffic Routing and Canary Analysis**: Implement progressive traffic routing from 1% to 100% with automated canary analysis, SLA monitoring, and automatic rollback triggers

4. **Production Readiness Checklist**: Generate comprehensive production readiness validation including security scanning, performance benchmarks, disaster recovery testing, and compliance verification

5. **Migration Execution Playbook**: Create step-by-step migration playbooks for each service with precise timing, rollback procedures, and communication protocols for the 24/7 operations team

I need this broken down with the same level of detail as Phase 3, including critical path analysis, resource assignments, and integration with our existing monitoring stack. The migration window must be executed during low-traffic periods (2-6 AM EST) with maximum 15-minute service interruption per service.

Also, generate contingency plans for the three highest-risk scenarios: database corruption during sync, service mesh failure, and load balancer configuration errors.
