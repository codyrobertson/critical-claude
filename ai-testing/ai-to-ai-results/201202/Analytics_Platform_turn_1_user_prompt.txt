I need to build a comprehensive data analytics platform for our enterprise clients. The system needs to handle real-time data ingestion from multiple sources (APIs, databases, file uploads), process it through ML pipelines for predictive analytics, and serve interactive dashboards with sub-second query performance. 

Key requirements:
- Ingest data from 50+ external APIs, PostgreSQL/MongoDB databases, and CSV/JSON file uploads
- Real-time stream processing using Apache Kafka with 100k+ events/second
- ML pipeline for customer churn prediction, revenue forecasting, and anomaly detection
- Interactive React dashboards with real-time updates via WebSockets
- Multi-tenant architecture supporting 500+ enterprise clients
- 99.9% uptime SLA with auto-scaling and disaster recovery
- GDPR/SOX compliance with audit logging and data encryption
- Performance targets: <200ms API response times, <2 second dashboard load times

I need this broken down into a complete project plan with realistic timelines, team assignments, technical dependencies, and risk mitigation strategies. The project should be structured for a 6-month delivery timeline with a team of 12 engineers across backend, ML, frontend, and DevOps specializations.

Create comprehensive tasks with proper prioritization, identify critical path dependencies, and include specific technology recommendations for each component. Also factor in testing strategies, security reviews, and phased rollout planning.
