The mobile development track is showing some concerning technical debt accumulation, and our offline sync mechanism is hitting edge cases we didn't anticipate. I need you to analyze the current mobile-dev-003 task tree, identify the specific technical debt items, and create a comprehensive refactoring plan. 

Additionally, our GPS tracking accuracy is inconsistent across different device types - particularly problematic on older Android devices and when transitioning between WiFi and cellular networks. The Bluetooth integration with fitness wearables is also dropping connections intermittently.

Break down the technical debt remediation into prioritized tasks, create a parallel debugging track for the GPS and Bluetooth issues, and establish integration testing scenarios that cover these edge cases. I also need risk assessment tasks for potential delays this might cause to our Sprint 3 deliverables.

Make sure to include performance benchmarking tasks and create dependencies that won't block our core development track while we address these issues.
