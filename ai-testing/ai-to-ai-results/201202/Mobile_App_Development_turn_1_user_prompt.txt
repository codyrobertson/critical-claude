I need to build a cross-platform mobile application for a fitness tracking startup. The app requires offline-first architecture with sync capabilities, real-time workout tracking with GPS, social features for sharing achievements, push notifications for workout reminders and friend activities, and integration with wearable devices via Bluetooth. The backend needs to handle millions of users with high availability, implement complex data analytics for personalized workout recommendations, and support multiple authentication providers. We're using React Native for mobile, Node.js microservices for backend, PostgreSQL for primary data, Redis for caching, and AWS for infrastructure. I need a complete project breakdown with technical implementation details, realistic time estimates, proper task dependencies, team role assignments, risk mitigation strategies, and integration testing plans. The project timeline is 6 months with a team of 8 developers across mobile, backend, DevOps, and QA specializations.
