I need to migrate our legacy monolithic Django application serving 200K+ active users to a modern microservices architecture using Node.js/TypeScript, while maintaining 99.9% uptime and zero data loss. The current system handles user authentication, content management, real-time notifications, payment processing, and analytics. We have a 4-month timeline, 12-person engineering team, and need to integrate with existing AWS infrastructure. Create a comprehensive migration strategy with detailed technical breakdown, risk mitigation plans, rollback procedures, and phased rollout approach. Include database migration from PostgreSQL to multi-database architecture, API versioning strategy, and performance benchmarking throughout the transition.
