I need to review and adjust the Phase 3 service extraction plan. The AI-generated breakdown looks good, but I want to modify the containerization strategy and add specific security requirements. 

First, show me the current status of all Phase 3 tasks, then I need to:

1. Update the containerization approach to use multi-stage Docker builds with distroless base images for better security
2. Add comprehensive API security testing including OWASP compliance checks
3. Create specific tasks for database migration scripts and rollback procedures
4. Add performance benchmarking tasks to ensure each extracted service meets SLA requirements
5. Include chaos engineering tests to validate service resilience

Also, I noticed we're behind schedule on the infrastructure tasks. Can you generate a recovery plan that identifies which tasks can be parallelized and create updated time estimates? We need to compress the timeline by 3 weeks without compromising quality.

Finally, create a comprehensive testing strategy that covers unit tests, integration tests, contract testing between services, and end-to-end testing scenarios. The testing should include load testing for 2x our current traffic volume since we're expecting growth during the migration period.
