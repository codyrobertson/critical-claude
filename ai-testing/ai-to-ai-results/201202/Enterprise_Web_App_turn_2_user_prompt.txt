Our current enterprise SaaS platform is showing signs of technical debt after 18 months of rapid development. We need to execute a comprehensive refactoring initiative while maintaining zero downtime and continuing feature development. The platform serves 50,000+ users across 200+ tenants with real-time collaboration features.

Key areas requiring immediate attention:
- Monolithic authentication service causing bottlenecks (3-second login times)
- Database schema needs normalization (query performance degraded 40%)
- Frontend bundle size has grown to 2.8MB causing slow initial loads
- WebSocket connections dropping under high load (>500 concurrent users)
- Legacy code in payment processing system flagged by security audit
- Test coverage dropped to 45% due to rushed feature releases
- Docker containers using outdated base images with known vulnerabilities

Business constraints:
- Cannot exceed 4-hour maintenance windows on weekends
- Must maintain API backward compatibility for existing integrations
- New features (AI-powered analytics dashboard) must launch in 10 weeks
- Current 8-person team, but can hire 2 additional senior engineers
- $150K budget for external tools/services if needed

Create a systematic refactoring roadmap that prioritizes critical performance issues, maintains development velocity, and incorporates the new AI analytics feature. I need detailed task breakdown with risk assessments, resource allocation, testing strategies, and rollback plans for each phase.
