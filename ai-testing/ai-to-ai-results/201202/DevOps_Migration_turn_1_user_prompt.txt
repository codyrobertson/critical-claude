I need to migrate our legacy monolithic Ruby on Rails application to a containerized microservices architecture on Kubernetes. The current system handles 500K+ daily transactions across user management, inventory tracking, order processing, payment gateway integration, and reporting. We need to maintain zero-downtime deployment, implement proper service mesh communication, set up comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, establish CI/CD pipelines with automated testing at each service level, and ensure proper data migration strategies for our PostgreSQL databases. The timeline is 6 months with a team of 8 engineers across backend, DevOps, and frontend. Break this down into a detailed project plan with task dependencies, resource allocation, risk mitigation strategies, and milestone deliverables. Include specific technical implementation tasks for containerization, service decomposition, API gateway setup, security hardening, and performance benchmarking.
