I need to build a comprehensive SaaS analytics dashboard for enterprise clients with real-time data visualization, multi-tenant architecture, and advanced security features. The system needs to handle 10M+ data points daily, support custom dashboards, integrate with major data sources (Salesforce, HubSpot, Google Analytics), implement role-based access control with SSO, and include automated reporting with scheduled exports. We also need a complete CI/CD pipeline, monitoring infrastructure, and compliance with SOC2 requirements. Create a detailed project breakdown with task dependencies, resource allocation, timeline estimates, and technical specifications for each component.
