### 🎭 AGENT INTERACTION PROTOCOLS

#### Multi-Agent Test Orchestration
```yaml
Test Coordination Pattern:
1. ALPHA creates tasks according to test scenarios
2. BETA executes workflow operations on ALPHA's tasks
3. GAMMA validates all data operations performed by ALPHA and BETA
4. DELTA measures performance of all operations
5. EPSILON validates end-to-end integration results

Communication Protocol:
- Agents communicate through standardized test result messages
- Each agent validates the previous agent's work
- Failed validations trigger immediate test failure
- Success chains enable progressive testing complexity
```

### 🚨 FAILURE DETECTION & RECOVERY

#### Agent Failure Patterns
```yaml
Common Failure Modes:
1. Syntax Deviation: Agent generates invalid CLI commands
2. Schema Violation: Agent creates non-compliant data
3. Workflow Error: Agent executes operations out of sequence
4. Performance Failure: Agent operations exceed time limits
5. Integration Failure: Agent cannot communicate with system

Recovery Protocols:
1. Immediate Test Halt: Critical failures stop all testing
2. Agent Reset: Failed agent reinitializes and retries
3. Cascade Prevention: Prevent failure propagation to other agents
4. State Recovery: Restore system to known good state
5. Failure Analysis: Log and analyze failure patterns
```

#### Automated Recovery System
```typescript
interface AgentFailureRecovery {
  detectFailure: (agent: AgentID, operation: string) => FailureType;
  initiateRecovery: (failure: FailureType) => RecoveryAction;
  validateRecovery: (action: RecoveryAction) => boolean;
  escalateIfNeeded: (failure: FailureType) => void;
}

const recoverFromFailure = async (agent: AgentID, failure: FailureType) => {
  // Stop current test execution
  await haltCurrentTest();
  
  // Reset failed agent
  await resetAgent(agent);
  
  // Restore system state
  await restoreKnownGoodState();
  
  // Retry operation
  const retryResult = await retryOperation(agent, failure.operation);
  
  if (!retryResult.success) {
    await escalateFailure(failure);
  }
};
```
