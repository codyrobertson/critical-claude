## 🔄 **Before vs After Comparison**

### ❌ **Old (Non-Semantic)**
```bash
cc crit arch .                 # What does "crit" mean? What is "arch"?
cc crit code file.ts           # Confusing abbreviations
cc task-ui                     # Hyphenated nonsense
cc-backlog cc-hooks-status     # Command name chaos
```

### ✅ **New (Semantic)**
```bash
cc analyze architecture        # Clear: analyze the architecture
cc analyze file src/auth.ts    # Clear: analyze this specific file  
cc task ui                     # Clear: task management UI
cc hook status                 # Clear: check hook status
```

## 📖 **Command Structure Philosophy**

### **Semantic Pattern: `cc <VERB> <NOUN> [TARGET]`**
- **VERB**: What action to perform (`analyze`, `review`, `task`, `hook`)
- **NOUN**: What type of thing (`file`, `architecture`, `codebase`)  
- **TARGET**: Specific target (file path, etc.)

### **Benefits of Semantic Structure:**
1. **Self-documenting** - Commands explain themselves
2. **Discoverable** - Easy to guess command names
3. **Consistent** - Same patterns across all features
4. **Professional** - Enterprise-ready command structure
5. **Intuitive** - Natural language patterns

## 🧪 **Tested and Working Commands**

### ✅ **File Analysis**
```bash
cc analyze file src/cli/unified-cc-router.ts
# ✅ Works - analyzes specific file for improvements
```

### ✅ **Architecture Analysis**  
```bash
cc analyze architecture
# ✅ Works - analyzes overall system architecture
```

### ✅ **Task Management**
```bash
cc task ui
# ✅ Works - launches task management interface
```

### ✅ **Help System**
```bash
cc --help
cc analyze --help  
cc review --help
# ✅ All help commands work with semantic structure
```

## 📋 **Command Completion Examples**

The new structure allows for natural tab completion:

```bash
cc <TAB>
# Shows: analyze, review, task, hook, plan, ui, status

cc analyze <TAB>  
# Shows: file, architecture, codebase

cc review <TAB>
# Shows: file, architecture  

cc task <TAB>
# Shows: list, ui, add, show, edit, delete
```
