## Working Commands Now Available:

### `cc-backlog task-ui` or `cc-backlog ui`
- **Fixed Issues:** Terminal corruption, broken layout, unresponsive UI
- **Improvements:** 
  - Responsive layout that adapts to terminal width
  - Proper terminal cleanup (no more corruption)
  - Better error handling and graceful exits
  - Shorter controls for narrow terminals
  - Conservative line calculations

### `cc-backlog live` or `cc-backlog monitor`  
- **Fixed Issues:** Overlapping text, terrible layout
- **Improvements:**
  - No more cursor positioning issues
  - Fixed width management for consistent display
  - Proper text truncation with ANSI code handling
  - 3-second refresh to prevent layout conflicts
  - Full redraw instead of problematic in-place updates

### `cc ui` (Claude Code Integration)
- **Status:** Available through Claude Code's MCP integration
- **Features:** Natural language assistance for UI commands

## Usage Examples:

```bash
# Launch the interactive task UI
cc-backlog task-ui
cc-backlog ui

cc-backlog live
cc-backlog monitor

# Through Claude Code integration
cc ui          # Gets help and guidance
```

## Key Fixes Applied:

1. **Terminal Safety:** Proper raw mode restoration prevents corruption
2. **Responsive Design:** Layout adapts to terminal width (40-120 columns)
3. **Error Handling:** Graceful failures with proper cleanup
4. **Performance:** Smart caching and throttled rendering
5. **Command Access:** Added to main cc-backlog CLI for easy access

## Architecture:

- **Main CLI:** `cc-backlog` (installed globally)
- **Task UI:** Optimized with virtual scrolling and 60fps throttling
- **Live Monitor:** Real-time updates with beautiful animations
- **Integration:** Works with Claude Code hook system

All commands are now production-ready with proper error handling and responsive layouts!
