📋 SUMMARY & NEXT STEPS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Fix SQL injection and password storage IMMEDIATELY
2. Add memory leak cleanup before next deploy
3. Optimize database queries in user components
4. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse

💡 PREVENTION STRATEGIES
• Use TypeScript strict mode to catch more issues
• Add pre-commit hooks for security scanning
• Implement proper error boundaries
• Set up monitoring for memory leaks

Working code beats perfect theory. Fix the real problems first.
