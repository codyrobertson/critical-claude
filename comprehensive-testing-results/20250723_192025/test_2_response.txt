I cannot create Jira tickets as I don't have access to Jira systems or APIs. I'm Claude Code, a CLI tool for software engineering tasks within your local codebase.

To create a Jira ticket, you'll need to:
1. Log into your Jira instance directly
2. Use Jira's web interface or their official CLI tool
3. Use their REST API if you want to automate ticket creation

If you'd like help with implementing OAuth authentication in your codebase instead, I can assist with that.
