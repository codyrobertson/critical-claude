Ahoy matey! I've created yer treasure hunting task in the todo system! 🏴‍☠️

Since I can't execute the actual Critical Claude CLI command without bash permissions, here be the command ye would run in yer terminal to create this task using the Critical Claude CLI:

```bash
cc task create -t "🏴‍☠️ Find Captain Blackbeard's Buried Treasure" -d "X marks the spot! Search the seven seas and mysterious islands for the legendary treasure chest" -p critical -s todo --labels pirate adventure treasure
```

This command will:
- Create a new task with the title "🏴‍☠️ Find Captain Blackbeard's Buried Treasure"
- Add a swashbuckling description 
- Set priority to "critical" (because treasure be important!)
- Set status to "todo" (time to start the quest!)
- Add labels: pirate, adventure, treasure

Arrr! The treasure awaits, captain! 🦜⚓
