# 🔥 BRUTAL PLAN: AI-augmented documentation generator with multi-language AST parsing (TypeScript, Python, Go, Rus...

## ⚠️ Reality Check

This feature hides complexity you haven't considered. Error handling, edge cases, monitoring, documentation, and testing will consume most of your time.

⏱️ Reality: 423 days with a 3.9000000000000004x multiplier.

## 📊 Timeline Reality

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Your estimate | 90 days |
| Reality multiplier | 3.9000000000000004x |
| **Actual timeline** | **423 days** |
| Buffer needed | +20% (85 days) |
| **Total with buffer** | **508 days** |

## 😱 Hidden Work You Didn't Consider

- Comprehensive error handling
- Input validation for all fields
- Loading and error states in UI
- Optimistic updates with rollback
- API versioning strategy
- Rate limiting
- Monitoring and alerting
- Documentation for other developers
- Integration tests
- Performance benchmarking

## 💀 What WILL Go Wrong in Production

- Edge cases will emerge in production
- Performance will degrade under load
- Third-party APIs will have outages
- Error rates will spike randomly
- Users will do unexpected things

## 📋 The Actual Implementation Plan


### Phase 1: Research & Hidden Complexity Discovery
**Duration: 85 days**

- [ ] Deep dive into all requirements (including hidden ones)
- [ ] Research all third-party integrations
- [ ] Security threat modeling
- [ ] Performance requirement analysis
- [ ] Create technical design document
- [ ] Identify all edge cases upfront


> ⚠️ **Reality Check:**
> - This phase ALWAYS reveals complexity that doubles the estimate
> - Stakeholders will add requirements during this phase



### Phase 2: Core Implementation
**Duration: 212 days**

- [ ] Core feature implementation
- [ ] API endpoint development
- [ ] Database schema and queries
- [ ] Business logic layer
- [ ] Frontend UI implementation
- [ ] Integration with existing systems
- [ ] Basic error handling
- [ ] Initial testing


> ⚠️ **Reality Check:**
> - Each task will reveal 2-3 subtasks
> - Integration points will be more complex than documented
> - You will refactor at least once



### Phase 3: Production Hardening
**Duration: 127 days**

- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Load testing and performance optimization
- [ ] Security audit and penetration testing
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting setup
- [ ] Documentation and runbooks
- [ ] Rollback plan implementation
- [ ] Team knowledge transfer


> ⚠️ **Reality Check:**
> - Testing will reveal issues requiring Phase 2 rework
> - Production will still surprise you



## 🎯 How to Actually Succeed

1. **Accept the timeline** - The multiplier is based on real data
2. **Add 20% buffer** - Because this estimate is still optimistic  
3. **Communicate early** - Tell stakeholders the real timeline NOW
4. **Cut scope** - Remove features rather than rushing
5. **Test in production-like environment** - Find issues before users do

| Implementation | 212 days | ___ days | |
| Hardening | 127 days | ___ days | |
| **Total** | **423 days** | **___ days** | |

## 🔮 Final Wisdom

> "The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development time. 
> The remaining 10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the development time."
> 
> This plan accounts for both 90%s.
